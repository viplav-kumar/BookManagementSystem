# Book-Managemen-System
ABOUT PROJECT : 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

This is an online book store (of Admin point of view) and moreover a book management system where we can keep track or manage our books as it gives us an access to view, add and delete books. This is a single page application (SPA) seperated into three secions, particularly - Search Books, Add Books and Book List. We can navigate among these sections via links provided
at the top of navbar, search books based on their any provided attribute be it their Id, Title or Author name and we can also get the books based on two filters which are maximum price and minimum rating, we can also delete the book from the data base with the help of delete button which is available with each book entry and add the book into the data base through add book form.

WHY I CHOSE THIS PROJECT :

Reason behind choosing this project was to learn, understand and demonstrate the basic functionality of add, delete and view (CRUD operation) with the help of basic of DOM manipulation using JavaScript. 

TECH STACK :  

This project is entirely made with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as tech stack.
For data base I have used local Storage and have used dummy books for the initial purpose.
